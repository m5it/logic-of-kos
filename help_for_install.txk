install.sh is used to link `Logic-Of-Kos` scripts to /usr/local/bin/... so they are accessable globaly.
For example:
    cputemp
Without linking you need to enter into current directory and run script like ./cputemp.sh or 
load current directory into $PATH variable.


Options:
-h     # Help
-v     # Version
-l     # Link
-u     # Unlink
-t     # Set new location to link to. Default /usr/local/bin/
