install.sh is used to link `Logic-Of-Kos` scripts to /usr/local/bin/... so they are acessible globaly.
Or load current directory into $PATH variable.

Options:
-h     # Help
-v     # Version
-l     # Link
-u     # Unlink
-L     # Set new location to link to. Default /usr/local/bin/
-F     # Fix install.dbk
